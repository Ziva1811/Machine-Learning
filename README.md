# Machine-Learning

ML is a way by which we can train the models from the given data and pick out some predictions.

ML is a tool by which we can train machines to act like human or to be intelligent.

we have 2 process in ML

     1. Training
     
     2. Predictions
     

First train the models and then predict

lets take an example:


We have bunch of images of a cat and we provide this (lablled) data to our model and train the model. Once the model is get trained. 

The result come out to be a prediction that "something with 2 eyes, 1 nose, whiskers, furry skin, tail" will be the cat.


Now when we will give another pic(of cat,unlablled data) which was not in that bunch of data the ml model will predict that it is a cat.
